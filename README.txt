Hello all! This is my second project through the Odin Project. This is a task to create a landing page closely matching the provided images.

Pre-project thoughts:
This looks considerably harder than the previous project. Funny enough, the flexbox work that we just learned looks to be the easiest part. I took a week or two off of coding for my mom to visit but this has made me seriously rusty! Today is 12/6/23. I'm going to spend time conceptualizing all this tonight before I officially start. Besides getting the first repo commit up, I'm hoping to plan how I'll tackle this challenge. I'm excited, that's for sure!
After looking at the image, my first guess is that I'll start by breaking it into 4 sections. First one can be a flexbox with two components, centered with spacing. One will contain the title, subtext, and button. The other side will contain the image.
Second section has a title, followed by a flexbox div with 4 evenly spaced curved corner boxes.
Third section will need an off-color change that I can find with color picker. Same as section 1.
Fourth is... Interesting. Could it be a flexbox with only a single element inside, centered by column and row...? On second thought, this must be the testing of a flexbox within a flexbox. Center by row and column the outer one, break the inner one into a 3x and a 1x, have text in the larger one and a button in the smaller.
Footer will be easy. I've done that in the previous project. It'll just be centering text and tinting the background. Ez pz.
Header looks intimidating, though. It would be easy if the logo was broken evenly with the others but it looks like it would be off center of a flexbox to the left. Am I using too many flexboxes? Maybe a simpler idea might be better here but it seems like they're so critical to organizing and we haven't even MENTIONED grids yet.

I'll give this my best shot and see how it goes. It's an interesting project no matter what.
